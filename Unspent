Hi
I m new in the bitcoin world! and of course i think i have make a mistake and i hope it can be resolved.
So i bought my first bitcoin with coinmama and i received them in my brand new electrum wallet 15min after everything was perfect.
Then i try to thumble my bitcoin. So i create another wallet who shuffle bitcoin. I choosed Electron-Cash! 
When i went in the Electron-Cash wallet to get the adress, it was a different adress who doesn't work with electrum send.
I ve seen in Electron-Cash wallet an adress converter, i used it and it change my adress in a format who seems like to be good.
I paste it in my electron wallet and the transaction started after some hours it was completed!! 
But nothing is arrived in electron-cash wallet.
When i follow the block it's wrinting "confirmed" and "unspent".
So i try to undertand my mistake and of course bitcoin and bitcoin-cash are different.
So my question is simple how do i do now to get those coins back?
Thanks best regards
